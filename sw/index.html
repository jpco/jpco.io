<h1>Introductions </h1>
<p>Hi!</p>

<p>My name is <a class="b">Jack Conger</a>.</p>

<p>When I was still a baby in the cold north of Alaska, my dad, a certified Windows know-it-all,
instilled in me an addiction to computers and problem-solving.</p>

<p>I've since switched to Linux and gained a <a class="b">passion for free and open-source software</a>, as well
as a driving urge for <a class="b">finding elegant solutions at the root</a> of problems I find&mdash;hence, I am pursuing
a math and computer science double major at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>

<h1>Believe in the Non-Sexy</h1>

<p>I believe in <a class="b">non-sexy software</a>: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/software.html">
software people don't even notice</a>, even though they use it every day of their lives; software that can 
be truly helpful to those in need, not simply an incremental improvement for affluent, privileged people 
in affluent, privileged parts of the world; software that is <a href="https://google.com/search?q=email+will+never+die">old, ugly, and infrastructural</a>.</p>

<p>Can you imagine if Tim Berners-Lee had made his WorldWideWeb the way Mark Zuckerberg made
Facebook?</p>
