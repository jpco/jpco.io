<h1>College, Year 2</h1>

<h2>Honors 232</h2>
<p>Honors 232, &#8220;Piracy&#8221;, represented my first and only academic encounter with the infamous Clarke Speed. Before I entered the class, I knew many people who had taken classes with him before, and their opinion of him was very polarized&mdash;which, knowing him, is the norm with his past students. My curiosity, and the rumours he'd been fired, drove me to the class.</p>

<p>The course itself was good. Primarily, I think it was worthwhile as an exercise in a non-typical kind of discourse, driven mostly by key terms and very exploratory. Some of the material itself, and especially the in-class discussions, was frustrating. One discussion in particular was somewhat about feminism and was very frustrating, which led to my artifact for this class: my <a href="ClSpAccu.pdf">final paper</a> (.pdf, source <a href="ClSpAccu.odt">here</a>).
</p>
<h2>Math 336</h2>
<p>Math 336 marked the end of what I am convinced was the hardest series I will take at the UW. Reaching the early graduate level, math 33X covers six 300- and 400-level mathematics classes, and leaves only 27 credits required to finish the comprehensive mathematics major.</p>

<p>One major aspect of the math 13X and 33X series is the process of beginning to think like a postgraduate mathematician. And, of course, part of this is research. Because of this, math 336 has as a final component a research paper dedicated to the short explanation of some journal article and the mathematical framework required to understand that article. I chose to write about combinatorics on words, a relatively new field in math dedicated to studying the types of sequences created by certain sets of symbols. My research is summarized in my <a href="336paper.pdf">paper</a> (<a href="336paper.tex">source</a>).</p>
