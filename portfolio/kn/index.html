<h1 class="banner">Part 1: Knowing</h1>

<p class="introp">My first two years at the UW were focused primarily on <em>knowing</em>: learning new ideas, new paradigms, relating disparate concepts, and building the foundation which I could use to <em>do</em> later on.</p>

<h1 style="margin-top: 1em;">Freshman Year</h1>

<h2>English 111: Science Fiction</h2>

<p>I took this class as my mandatory composition credit at the UW.  Surprisingly, it exposed me to some of the best works of the genre that I've read to date, which introduced me to concepts which would resonate through the rest of my time here at college.</p>

<p><a href="engl111mp2.pdf">This</a> is the second major paper I wrote for this class, on gender and capitalism in potential futures.</p>


<h2>Math 136</h2>

<p>The Math 13X (and 33X) series is possibly the defining class series I have taken at the UW.  It requires of its students a maturity and self-assuredness in mathematics that most don't experience until their senior year (or even graduate school!)</p>

<p>Included in this is the notion of self-guided mathematical research.  The third quarter of the series, Math 136, requires a group research paper on some application of linear algebra.  My group researched and presented a paper on using linear algebraic methods as part of a model of cancer metastasis.  <a href="math136final.pdf">This paper</a> is the first time that, in a math class, I have studied and implemented a mathematical method as part of a real concrete application, rather than for the loose, airy goal of &ldquo;truth&rdquo;.</p>


<h2>Honors 212: Nabokov</h2>

<p>This class, primarily on Vladimir Nabokov's first three novels written in America (that is, <em>Pnin</em>, <em>Lolita</em>, and <em>Pale Fire</em>,) was difficult&mdash;and not just because of the author's prose.  This class, taught by a leading Nabokov scholar, provided a uniquely in-depth look at a work of art which is supremely well-executed, but morally... difficult, to put it mildly (for the uninitiated, this is <em>Lolita</em>). </p>

<p><a href="honors212final.pdf">This</a> is my final paper for this class.  I shied away from the central moral conundrum of his works, as might be expected&mdash; even now, the topic is intimidating, and the stakes of the discussion are high.  For simplicity, I chose to discuss a more removed, formal, philosophical aspect of the author's writing.  Part of the maturation of my thought over college has been deeper engagement with more difficult, immediate topics.</p>


<h1>Sophomore Year</h1>

<h2>Honors 394: Feminism &amp; Philosophy</h2>

<p>This class, taught by Clare Bright, is a survey of philosophers and schools of thought in Western philosophy, and specifically, how the people and ways of thinking we studied regarded and reflected back on women of the time&mdash;and, often, how women responded to those ways of thought.  The ethical implications of the class, I think, are obvious: Our thoughts do not exist in a vacuum.  They must be applied in the abstract, and in the concrete as well.</p>

<p><a href="clarebrightfinal.pdf">Here</a> is my final paper for this class.  Though somewhat basic as feminist thought in itself, it does illustrate the point rather clearly: philosophy, rather than being abstract and external to the world, is immediate and directly connected to it.</p>


<h2>Honors 232: Piracy</h2>

<p>This class was my only interaction with the infamous Clarke Speed.  Honestly, I haven't disagreed with peoples' complaints&mdash;his method of discouse is downright weird, he gives off an air of self-absorption, and I defintiely believe his class provides a more fruitful space for male students than female (though as to <em>why</em>, I'm not sure&mdash;there's more on this topic in my artifact).</p>

<p>However, there was an entertaining self-reflexiveness to the discourse.  Every essay we wrote included a section called &ldquo;word work&rdquo;, where we define the terms we use, which enables one to make essays hyper-dense and exploratory.  In-class discussion was somewhat entertaining as well, though occasionally, it was horribly frustrating.  One especially frustrating day inspired <a href="ClSpAccu.pdf">my artifact</a>, an essay on the ways men can (and can't) interact with women's spaces&mdash;ways that my own physical presence &amp; reality affects the intellectual spaces I inhabit and the people who are around me.</p>
