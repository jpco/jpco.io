<h1>College, Year 1</h1>

<h2>CSE 143</h2>
<h2>Math 136</h2>

<p><a href="136finalreport.pdf">This paper</a> (.pdf, source <a href="136finalreport.tex">here</a>) is in a sense the final project for the year-long Math 134-135-136 ("Honors Accelerated Calculus") series I took during my freshman year. The three-quarters-long series focuses on the material from the freshman calculus as well as Math 307 and 308. However, the major learning experience for myself during this course was its intense proof-based focus: previously, my math classes had been focused on formulae and ideas, and not the method of their formulation.</p>

<p>This series was the first time I was truly made to deeply understand the mental and mathematical path to the conclusions I was being taught. At the end of the course, this project was assigned to groups to connect ideas from linear algebra to a more specific tool (genetics, Markov chains, etc., or our own choice) using our own research. This tool would need to be defined and understood before being used. Our project (details in the document itself, of course,) happened to deal with Markov chains, oncology, and (some) programming; in addition to having to deeply understand what each of these (and especially Markov chains) are, I had to understand how each are connected to each other.</p>
