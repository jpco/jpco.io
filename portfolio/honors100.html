<h1>UW Honors 100 Assignments</h1>
<p>My first quarter at the University of Washington, I took Honors 100 as part of my interdisciplinary honors requirements. I completed a number of assignments for that class, some of which are included here. I won't alter them, even though things like my four-year plan have changed drastically from how I thought they'd be at the time.</p>
<h2>First Reflection</h2>

<p class="intro">&#8220;Why did you come to the UW and join the Honors Program? What are your expectations of yourself while at UW and in Honors?&#8221;</p>

<p>Initially, I never really even considered the University of Washington as a place I’d want to go. It was a good school, sure, but there are dozens, if not hundreds, of schools I would consider “good” anywhere in America. My dad always had a soft spot for the Huskies on ESPN, but that was really the only tie I could claim to have with the school. However, the summer before my senior year of high school, we visited Seattle and spent some time visiting campuses around town, including this school. I was wowed by the campus; that’s when the school grabbed my attention first.</p>

<p>I started researching the school, though, and noticed it had all the things I was looking for in a school. It’s big, so it can provide a strong community for whatever interest I might have, no matter how obscure it is. It’s in a primarily liberal urban area near the coastline. It’s on the quarter system, and is strong all around; in fact, it’s not just a good school, it’s a great one – seventeenth in the world by one ranking, if I’m not mistaken. So I applied. I’d heard horror stories from people about going to a big school and feeling lost in a sea of people, but I wasn’t dissuaded; I knew I’d only be limited if I went to an especially specialized school.</p>

<p>So, I applied. And along with the school, I applied for the honors program, mostly because it was right on the regular application. I can honestly say I never expected to get accepted: a friend of mine, a year earlier, would have gone to the school if she had been invited, but she wasn’t. I consider her a much better student than myself, so when I applied for the honors college it was really on a wild hair. When I actually was accepted, it was a total surprise.</p>

<p>But I began to consider the honors program, I saw more and more what would be good about it. It would be an opportunity to distinguish myself from the vast swath of students attending the school, and would give me more opportunity to take difficult and fulfilling classes. It seemed to have a well-balanced, integrated curriculum, much like the IB program in high school, which would let me connect the disparate classes and disciplines to which I would be subjected. Most importantly of all, though, the honors program here would provide me with a community of like-minded people, with whom I could mesh and take part in things that interest all of us.</p>

<p>All in all, that’s what I hope to get out of attending the Honors Program here. A place where I can be challenged to be better than myself; where I will have to work to rise to the challenges facing me. The UW and the Honors Program here will help me grow to become a better, more developed, and smarter person than I was before. The opportunity is now, and I simply have to fulfill it.</p>

<h2>Experiential Learning</h2>
<p class="intro">Here is the write-up Andrew Cronenburg wrote for me as a suggestion for an experiential learning project.</p>

<p>In our interview, Jack noted that he was interested in a wide variety of subjects ranging from physics to music to sociology, but his primary interest was focused on astronomy. Since I am currently taking ASTRO 101 and also have a strong interest in astronomy, I came up with a potential experiential learning opportunity for Jack that deals with research, observation, and discovery of extrasolar planets, or exoplanets. Pursuing such an opportunity requires application of many different abilities which are clearly exemplified in the interests Jack told me about—a sense of creativity cultivated via music to aid the discovery process, a strong understanding of physics to interpret data and correlate it to the physical behavior of the planets, and a passion for exploring and discovering that which lies in the deep unknown. Thus, I determined from Jack’s varied interests and educational plans that extrasolar planets would be a perfect subject for application of experiential learning to his academic plans.</p>

<p>Recent research has surged in the realm of exoplanets, with new ones being discovered at exponentially increasing rates and information being continually provided to update older discoveries. As such, experiential learning pertaining to research would best fit Jack’s inclination to pursue astronomy beyond the classroom. Furthermore, research in this particular field is both relevant and timely to contemporary astronomy and offers a variety of opportunities for further enrichment. At the University of Washington, undergraduate research in astronomy appears to be highly self directed, but there are a variety of faculty who can mentor and assist in the process and a diverse range of resources to utilize.</p>

<p>The plan is as follows: Jack first needs to get connected to undergraduate research by attending an Undergraduate Research Program session, followed by taking the General Studies 391 class in the wintertime that further examines key principles and issues. Following this, he should meet with Nancy Thomas, an undergraduate research leader who has research experience dealing with exoplanets, and Eric Agol, a UW faculty member who has also directed research into exoplanets. Both should be able to provide quality information on the subject, potential connections for ongoing research, and effective mentorship in conducting the process of research. Following this, Jack should go to one of UW’s many observatories—some which are accessed remotely or within 100 miles of UW, and one observatory that is located on the UW campus. These observatories will provide the necessary resources for conducting research into exoplanets. Finally, Jack should present his findings at the annual Undergraduate Research Symposium, which may give impetus to further research into the topic or exploration of other subjects within astronomy.</p>

<p>&mdash; HONORS 394 D: Exploring the Power of Music</p>

<p class="intro">“In this experiential course we will examine some of the universal themes emerging from the use of music and its influence on humanity and our world. Our ten week journey will utilize various lenses through which we will explore the topic, including scientific and academic research, observation of collective human experience, and your own personal experience both in and outside of class. Our time together will be partially modeled on the goals and objectives of collaborative teaching/learning communities. Activities will include class visits from guest experts and group and individual research opportunities along with weekly musical explorations facilitated by the instructor. During this process we will also examine how it affects and empowers our own lives.”—UW Honors website</p>

<p>Music has always been an important part of my life, and I have always liked to think about and research the social and environmental causes and effects of music in my own life and in general. This class seems to consider the same things I have over the years, so I’d love to be able to gain reinforcement and responses to my own ideas on the subject.</p>

<p>&mdash; HONORS 222 B: Astrobiology</p>

<p class="intro">“This course provides an overview of a new multidisciplinary science, Astrobiology, with emphasis on the delivery of organic molecules by comets and asteroids. This course will provide knowledge in chemistry, history of sciences, biochemistry, astronomy, geology, geochemistry and biology. In addition, students will learn about different analytical instruments that scientists use to investigate meteorites, but which can also be used to make research in many other different fields.”—Graciela Matrajt’s class website for an old astrobiology class (I’m assuming the class hasn’t changed very much)</p>

<p>Astronomy and space are very old passions of mine. I can still remember watching space documentaries as a ten-year-old with my dad and knowing most of the material they covered. I have books both non-fiction and science-fiction on the shelves at home, and I follow space news like most people follow politics. Naturally, one of my interests as a part of this is the potential for life on other planets, and what form that life would take on the sort of planets and moons we know about. Learning about this in a more rigorous environment than I already have would be great.</p>

<p>&mdash; CSE 341: Programming Languages</p>

<p class="intro">“Basic concepts of programming languages, including abstraction mechanisms, types, and scoping. Detailed study of several different programming paradigms, such as functional, object-oriented, and logic programming.”—CSE website</p>

<p>Programming has been an interest of mine for a few years as well, and I’d like to branch out from the one or two closely-related languages I have experience with and learn about how other languages work, and this class seems to fit the bill quite nicely.</p>


<h2>Portfolio Statement</h2>

<p>When I came to the University of Washington at the beginning of this year, I was truly a fish out of water. I had very little knowledge about either the area or, honestly, the school – aside from the cursory knowledge and stereotypes high school seniors gain about many different schools during the application process, when I came here, I knew very little about the various degree programs and the actual academic environment I would be joining. Even more, I knew very little about how I would behave in the university environment.</p>

<p>Now, I have a much clearer picture of my relationship with the university. One of the most important things I’ve learned is the pace of the courses I’m taking, which helps me know what accelerated classes I can take and what sort of course load I can handle. Even more, it’s changed the goals I’ve had for my majors; partly as a result of my course requirements for various majors, but partly because college has helped solidify my interests. This was a big surprise for me, but it makes sense. I was thrown into a foreign environment, which helped me realize exactly the activities I hold dear and want to pursue. Now that I have started to create these more solid goals, I can get along with making connections with people at the UW around these.</p>

<p>In fact, this is what I thought was the most helpful part of Honors 100. We had community building and talked to the honors librarian, as well as various honors professors. In this way, we got help building connections with various people in the school who could help us along the way, which I have always thought to be one of the most important aspects of college. This will, of course, be a constant process throughout my college experience, but I think the time in Honors 100 has provided a good start.</p>

<p>This will be extremely helpful as time goes by. As I was surprised to discover, there is a detriment to the simply huge amount of various activities and projects at the UW: it is often extremely difficult to know what events are happening. It can be difficult to find the right mailing lists to be a part of, or the right people to follow, until one has already stumbled into the events that they wanted to take part in originally. So far, I have had some success finding these, but it has taken a good amount of luck to do so. This is one of the biggest things I hope to do by the end of my first year: I want to have a good number of connections and good communities to be in. Doing that will be an important part of gaining the skills and friends I hope to have when I graduate and am ready to move into the real world.</p>
