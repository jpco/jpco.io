<h1>UW Honors Portfolio</h1>

In my English 111 class, I was assigned Ted Chiang's short story <q>Liking What You See</q>, a story about a phenomenon called calliagnosia.  In the story, calliagnosia is a medical procedure a person can undergo which makes them blind to attractiveness.  It is safe and reversible, and causes no other issues in perception.  The meat of the story follows a number of interviews, news stories, and press releases as the politics of calli and its implementation are hashed out.

It's a fascinating and thought-provoking story, which illustrates a central theme in science fiction, and a central theme in my college career: how do the things we make, make us?  What do our engineering and creative choices do to us as creators, and to others as our audience?   How do we weigh things which are <i>true</i> against things which are <i>good</i>&mdash;is there a difference?  What are the moral qualities of the software I make?  What are the moral qualities of the math I do?  What are the moral qualities of my role in theatre?

The act of answering these questions is much, much larger than is quite contained in my academic work.  These are questions I've been working on through articles and books I read outside of my own classwork.  These questions are cross-disciplinary, echoing from what I learn in my major classes to what I learn in my non-major classes, and echoing back from those classes as they translate from theory to praxis.  It's a set of questions that, even in the limited scope on which I focus, I will almost certainly never finish addressing through my life.

This statement serves as an introduction to the issues; hopefully, the entries in this portfolio will illustrate more in detail what I've been working on.

Thanks for reading.
